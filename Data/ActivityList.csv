No matter the activity, security and law enforcement will need to understand things like the basics of infectious disease epidemiology generally; key characteristics of the infectious disease responsible for the outbreak; the public health and other legal authorities that need to be enforced; any unique cultural considerations relevant to the perpetuation of the outbreak; and pathways for sharing information with their public health counterparts.</p><p>One important way to train security and law enforcement personnel is through outbreak exercises or table-top simulations. At least some of these exercises or simulations should be joint events with public health officials, thereby allowing each sector to help educate and train the other. Countries should be able to demonstrate that these sectors’ authorities have engaged in joint trainings to orient, exercise, and institutionalize knowledge of memoranda of understanding (MoU) or other agreements that outline role of responsibilities of security and law enforcement and other sectors which have been established to help enhance coordination.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup></p><p>In some countries, joint training opportunities are available from government sources. In the United States, for instance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Centers for Disease Control offers a joint criminal-epidemiological training course for public health events and agricultural outbreaks to ensure roles and responsibilities are clear among public health and security actors. They also publish a handbook, which can be used to help train and guide these sectors in other countries.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup> This kind of coordination between law enforcement and public health will be especially important in dealing with outbreaks that are or may be the result of an intentional act.</p><p>Outbreaks may occur in zones or countries with a fragile security situation made worse by an outbreak, and which may impede public health and humanitarian efforts to respond to the outbreak. While security and law enforcement may already be trained to handle themselves in difficult security situations, additional training will be required to enable their full awareness of the disease transmission and cultural dynamics occurring in certain areas that are perpetuating disease spread or preventing health workers for providing the care needed to mitigate that spread.</p>",,"Surveillance & preparedness,Intervention",,"Health authorities,Private sector organizations,National militaries and UN peacekeeping missions,Police and law enforcement organizations,Security authorities,International NGOs,Local NGOs","Security authorities,Police and law enforcement organizations,National militaries and UN peacekeeping missions,UN Security Council","Police and law enforcement organizations,Security authorities,National militaries and UN peacekeeping missions,International NGOs,Local NGOs,Health authorities,Private sector laboratories",,,,,"Zoonotic,Human-only,Animal-only","Permissive,Non-permissive","Subnational,National,International","Accidental,Deliberate,Unknown origin,Natural","Localized syndromic event (e.g. a cluster of encephalitis with no known causative agent),Localized exposure (environmental / foodborne / waterborne / poisonings / pollutants),Zoonotic spillover with human-to-human transmission* (*with repeated reintroduction),Vector-borne transmission with human-to-human transmission* (*human-mediated),Vector-borne transmission without known onward transmission,Human pathogen with environmental transmission* (non-respiratory e.g. water-borne pathogens),Human pathogen with respiratory transmission* (*including for example historical point-source zoonotic origin),Human pathogen with transmission through bodily fluids,Zoonotic spillover without known onward transmission,Vector-borne transmission with human-to-human transmission* (*vector-mediated)",,,,Coordinate with security sector and law enforcement,,,

Many countries have come to rely on formal <em>surveillance systems</em> , “a collection of processes and components that enable public health practitioners to conduct surveillance. Surveillance processes include data collection, data quality monitoring, data management, data analysis, interpretation of analytical results, information dissemination, and application of the information to public health programs.”<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup>  That is, it is not enough to have individual activities or programs that collect data—the individual elements that comprise data collection and usage should be aligned within and among programs to create an efficient process and useful operating picture.</p><p>The World Health Organization’s <em>Outbreak Toolkit</em> is a valuable resource for understanding what data to collect and how to collect it.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup> The Toolkit’s <em>Data Collection Standard</em> , for instance, walks the reader through what information to collect and provides form for doing so. While paper forms have been important historically and may still be used in cases where power or resources make digital collection a hardship, surveillance data should ideally be collected, managed, and analyzed using an electronic data management system. Such electronic tools can ensure standardization, easy analysis, and easy sharing. Because data may often be epidemiologic line data—i.e., lists of detailed information about every case or suspected case in an outbreak—the volume can be considerable, making a digital means of management almost requisite to ensure all data are properly captured and stored. Field data capture can use software (some of which is free of cost) like Kobo-collect, Go data, Epi-info, and even Microsoft Excel.</p><em>Sharing</em><p></p><p>For intelligence to be useful, it must be shared. An additional benefit of digital data management is that it also helps facilitate downstream steps including the rapid dissemination of information across the various sectors involved in the prevention, detection, and response to outbreaks. The sharing the data and information with all stakeholders is an essential part of the surveillance process, crucial to facilitating a comprehensive response to a public health event. Sectors involved may include the Early Warning and Response coordination unit, the International Health Regulations National Focal Point,<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""4"">4</sup> animal health and environmental health ministries, clinicians, private sector actors, and various other entities involved in the prevention, detection, and response to public health emergencies. Adhering to local, national, and international reporting procedures is requisite to ensuring an effective response. Internationally, the WHO is one consumer of the epidemic intelligence that countries produce and report, using that information to make decisions; in some cases, reporting to the WHO is required by the International Health Regulations.

Ideally, samples should be collected prior to the administration of antivirals or antibiotics. The type of sample collected will depend on the suspected pathogen; to assess for the presence of a bloodborne pathogen, for instance, blood samples will be needed.

Providers must take care to follow best practices so as to avoid transmitting the pathogen via healthcare-associated infection. This may be a challenge with an emerging disease that is as yet unknown or about which little is known, but where guidance is available, it should be followed.

The purpose of decontamination in the context of an outbreak of infectious disease is to clean these objects in order to reduce the risk of spread of the pathogen to people.</p><p>Decontamination is an important element of infection prevention and control. When done effectively, it can help limit pathogen transmission by reducing the burden of pathogen in the environment, especially the built environment. A variety of infrastructures and areas will require decontamination, including hospital facilities, isolation centers, burial sites, and homes.</p><p>It is first necessary to assess the nature and extent of infrastructure contamination. This assessment will be based on the best scientific information to date about the pathogen and how it spreads. Officials may wish to perform environmental sampling to assess pathogen presence and burden in particular areas and how well decontamination measures are working. Officials should determine which areas need to be cleaned, including building surfaces (e.g., floors, walls, counters, door handles), ventilation systems, or any other areas that could have been exposed to the pathogen based on the circumstances of how it arrived and how it spreads. Assessment should also consider vehicles such as ambulances or others used to transport infected or potentially infected patients. Evaluation should also be made of major elements within the infrastructure, such as beds, wheelchairs, and medical equipment.</p><p>Successful decontamination involves choosing the correct disinfectant and the appropriate cleaning methods. Maximum effectiveness from disinfection results from an initial, thorough removal of organic and inorganic materials in order to prevent these materials from interfering with decontamination effectiveness.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> This cleaning to remove visible soil can be accomplished manually or mechanically using detergents or enzymatic products. Next, disinfectants that may be available include alcohol, chlorine, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, iodophors, ortho-phthalaldehyde, peracetic acid, phenolics, and quaternary ammonium compounds. <em>Not all disinfectants will work against all pathogens</em> . Also, because these compounds can be caustic, care must be taken to ensure the health and safety of those using or otherwise exposed to them. In addition to disinfections, other processes might include pasteurization and the use of ultraviolet light.</p><p>It is crucial to choose a disinfectant based on the properties of the agent. <em> </em> General infection prevention and control measures that address decontamination of the built environment may help decontamination for a novel pathogen, but it will be important to follow the best evidence emerging about how well the pathogen in question is counteracted by disinfectants and procedures.

A public health needs assessment is a critical tool for determining public health requirements, as well as knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the exposed, or likely exposed, population. An assessment encourages the response team to avoid decision-making based on individual anecdotes and qualitative observations, instead promoting evidence-based decisions that address the needs of the entire community.</p><p>The data gathered should be analyzed in order to adequately inform decision makers and identify resources and activities needed for an effective and comprehensive response. Needs assessments allow for the collection of information and evaluation of the scope of the threat. This information guides the response team in anticipating health care needs, managing acute issues, and allocating limited resources. Put simply, a needs assessment is a valuable tool for comprehending and addressing an outbreak in a timely, fact-based, and thorough manner.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup></p><p>One example of a public health needs assessment is the U.S. CDC Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response (CASPER) process, designed to help guide a community needs assessment in order to prioritize resources in an emergency response. CASPERs are generally used when the response team has limited or no information on aspects of a disaster such as its overall effect on a population or the current health status and basic needs of that population. As well, a CASPER can be useful when the response and recovery efforts must be evaluated. Before conducting a CASPER, the public health officials ought to identify the purpose, setting, and availability of resources.</p><p>In a CASPER, public health practitioners and emergency management officials rapidly characterize the health status and basic needs of the affected community. They rely on valid statistical methods to quantify health and basic needs, such that emergency leadership can prioritize aspects of their response and allocate resources accordingly. A CASPER is most effective if conducted in partnership with key stakeholders (local, state, and federal partners; private or nongovernmental organizations; educational institutions) who can offer unique subject matter expertise, analytical support, ground information, and other useful insight.</p><p>The main objectives of a CASPER are:</p><p><ul><li>determine the critical health needs and assess the impact of the disaster, </li> <li>characterize the population residing in the affected area, </li> <li>produce household-based information and estimates for decision-makers, and </li> <li>evaluate the effectiveness of relief efforts through conducting a follow-up CASPER. </li></ul></p><p>These objectives are met by responding promptly to an outbreak with a carefully laid-out assessment plan in a specified physical area.

Claire Comment:
This activity combines assessment of the surveillance system with gap analysis (previously a separate activity). I mention risk assessments as being a tool to inform the gap analysis portion of surveillance assessment – is there a way to cross-reference between activities? 
 
For Stakeholders, depending on the country’s health system and the extent to which partners are implicated in (particularly vertical) disease surveillance, WHO and International NGOs may also need to be included. I have added “Post-intervention and recovery” since the way that WHO and others define assessment of surveillance systems also includes an evaluation element, to review how quickly and accurately the system identified new public health events.  ",,"Added private labs - not sure

In general, surveillance for infectious disease comes from two primary channels, both of which are necessary to optimize early warning:</p><p><ul><li><strong>Indicator-based surveillance (IBS)</strong>: a classic way of reporting diseases involving reports of specific diseases from health care providers to public health officials; these data are usually structured.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup> <em>Example: reports received on a regular basis and entered routinely into a disease-reporting database on the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza identified at a hospital laboratory.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup></em></li> <li><strong>Event-based surveillance (EBS)</strong>: the organized collection, monitoring and assessment of largely unstructured, ad hoc information to detect any event which may represent an acute risk to health.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup> Information is obtained from multiple sources that can be official, unofficial or informal in nature. <em>Example: a teacher notices an unusually high number of children absent from school with similar symptoms and reports it to a local health official.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""4"">4</sup></em></li></ul></p><p>IBS helps provide information about the frequency, origin, and distribution of reportable national and international diseases.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""5"">5</sup> The goal is to rapidly detect potential outbreak signals based on analysis of structured, formal, health-based data sources. IBS offers a means of systematically collecting, monitoring, analyzing, and interpreting structured health data to identify potential outbreak signals. IBS generally helps alert public health officials to <em>known diseases</em> (as opposed to EBS, which can help with both knowns and unknowns). IBS is often focused on a list of notifiable diseases in which entities are required—either legally or through regulation—to report information related to the identified syndromes. Four kinds of surveillance data generally feed into IBS systems:</p><p><ul><li><em>Conventional disease-specific (biologic)</em>: based on highly specific case definitions that usually include biological, clinical and/or para-clinical components; widely applied to communicable diseases<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""6"">6</sup></li> <li><em>Syndromic</em>: based on case definitions made up of associations of symptoms without etiological confirmation; permits wide surveillance coverage for emerging infectious diseases<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""7"">7</sup></li> <li><em>Comprehensive (facility-based)</em>: requires all identified sources to report; usually used in disease eradication programs or for diseases requiring immediate public health attention<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""8"">8</sup></li> <li><em>Sentinel</em>: requires only a fraction of health care structures to report; usually used for endemic diseases, epidemic-prone diseases, diseases not requiring immediate public health action, and frequent diseases for which a change in pattern might be noteworthy<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""9"">9</sup></li> <li><em>Laboratory-based</em>: conducted at laboratories to detect events or trends; mainly done routinely or used when conducting sentinel surveillance<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""10"">10</sup> </li> <li><em>Case-based</em>: ongoing and rapid identification of identifiable cases for the purpose of case follow-up; used for diseases targeted for elimination or eradication or during confirmed outbreaks<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""11"">11</sup></li> <li><em>Community-based</em>: systematic detection and reporting of events of public health significance within the community by community members<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""12"">12</sup></li></ul></p><p>Structured health data can come through standardized channels such as regular disease incidence reports from hospitals or local jurisdictions up to higher levels, including national.

A pathogen can be transmitted from reservoir to host in a number of ways, and these modes of transmission can be classified differently.</p><p>Mode of transmission may be direct or indirect. With direct transmission, the infectious agent is transferred from a reservoir to a susceptible host by direct contact or droplet spread. For direct contact, the agent is transmitted by physical contact between individuals through skin-to-skin contact, kissing, and sexual intercourse. Some kinds of direct transmission are site specific. Droplet spread of a pathogen to a new host refers to spray with relatively large, short-range aerosols produced by sneezing, coughing or talking.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup> For indirect transmission, the infectious agent is transferred by airborne, vehicle-borne or vector-borne (mechanical or biological) means. Airborne transmission involves dust and fine particles known as aerosols suspended in air to carry infectious agents. Vehicles which facilitate indirect transmission include food, water, biologic products, and fomites. A vehicle may passively carry a pathogen or may provide an environment in which the agent grows.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> Vector transmission occurs through mechanical and biological means. Common vectors include mosquitos, fleas, and ticks.</p><p>When interpreting an epidemic curve (often referred to as an “epi curve”), modes of transmission are typically categorized as point source, continuous common source, and person-to-person spread.

The National Focal Point for the International Health Regulations (IHR) must be represented in the committee. Examples of other stakeholders that should be represented on the inter-agency coordinating committee include the directorates of health services, directorates of veterinary services, the food safety agency, disaster management authorities, humanitarian response agencies, environmental protection authorities, regulatory bodies, national reference laboratories (human and animal), and the national public health Emergency Operations Center. The committee should not be formed <em>ad hoc </em> at the outset of an emerging event but rather meet regularly, such as on a monthly or quarterly business, in order to be most effective at mitigating and rapidly responding to new threats. The inter-agency coordinating committee is often well placed to develop the national public health emergency response plan, incorporating input from all relevant sectors, and ensuring formalized mechanisms are established between the various stakeholders to ensure the timely and comprehensive sharing of information. At its outset, the inter-agency coordinating committee should also be authorized to make recommendations on specific problems, and ensure the ability—including adequate financial resources—the assign task forces or teams to address emerging threats. The inter-agency coordinating committee should also be responsible for the regular review and updating as needed of the national public health emergency response plan, and any associated hazard-specific plans.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup> Other plans and policies foundational to the implementation of IHR that the inter-agency coordinating committee may develop, or contribute to, include plans for integrated surveillance for antimicrobial resistance, lists of national priority zoonotic diseases, and workforce development strategies.</p><p>Routine activities that can be performed by the inter-agency coordinating committee, and included as items of business at the regular meetings, include:</p><p><ul><li>Sharing of information on each sector’s risk monitoring;</li> <li>Reviewing stocks of equipment for event investigation and response;</li> <li>Providing recommendations on on-going or emerging events of potential public health importance. </li></ul></p><p>It is important to note that the information-sharing that forms the core of the inter-agency coordinating committee’s mandate and purpose should be multidirectional, with all stakeholders receiving mutual benefit to advance their own sectoral priorities.

Claire Notes: For Stakeholders, “National and subnational disaster management authorities” are not currently listed in the “Stakeholders” tab in the Excel sheet – it should be added. For Geographic Scale: it is not clear to me how, practically speaking, there is a difference between “National” and “International” from the perspective of a country response. If they have an outbreak within their borders, they will likely mostly manage it in similar ways, using similar resources, whether it crosses into other countries or not. There are only a few capacities that would additionally be needed to address specifically international outbreaks, but an inter-agency coordinating committee, for example, would still primarily focus on the national response. It may be worth making a very clear definition for what we are capturing under “International” capacities.

A key defining feature of an epidemic is rise in case reports above a normal or expected level. (Note that epidemiologists often use the terms <em>outbreak</em> and <em>epidemic </em> interchangeably; that tradition is followed in this summary.) Thus, an important step in the confirmation process is the comparison of the number of expected cases at a particular place and time with the actual number of reported cases.</p><p>In contrast to an epidemic, a  <em>cluster</em>  is an aggregation of cases in a given area over a particular period without regard to whether the number of cases is more than expected.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup> A key step in confirming the existence of an epidemic—a number of cases above normal expectations—is thus to determine whether a cluster is in fact an epidemic.

For a notifiable disease, the expected number is based on health department surveillance records. For other diseases and conditions, the expected number may be based on locally available data such as hospital discharge records, mortality statistics, or cancer or birth defect registries. When local data are not available, a health department may use rates from state or national data, or, alternatively, conduct a telephone survey of physicians to determine whether they are seeing more cases of the disease than usual. Finally, a survey of the community may be conducted to establish the background or historical level of disease.”</em><p>Other causes for a rise in cases or a perceived rise in cases procedures may explain an excess number of cases. These need to be investigated and ruled out. Such factors can include changes in local reporting processes, changes in case definitions, increased local or national awareness of a disease, or alterations to diagnostic testing procedures.

Emergency response policies should acknowledge their value by providing clear, effective guidelines on this subject. Notably, identification of cases can allow for early and targeted treatment, protect against community transmission, and contribute to an informed understanding of the outbreak. However, individuals may not understand the value of screening. A mandatory testing program could be perceived as a threat against civil liberties<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup> rather than an essential component of addressing an outbreak. Policies should also reflect this potential distrust in or rejection of screening and/or testing, providing alternatives when appropriate and enabling compulsory action if necessary.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup></p><p>Policies on mandatory screenings and/or testing should be integrated into the emergency response plan to inform protocols. Collecting surveillance information is generally mandatory and ethically acceptable on the grounds of public interest. This eliminates the possibility of individual refusal.

Informed consent prior to testing or screening presents an opportunity for individuals to maintain their autonomy and foster a collaborative relationship between citizens and health professionals.

Surveillance refers to the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of outcome-specific data for planning, implementing, and evaluating public health policies and practices. In the context of outbreaks, the principal functions of the surveillance system are early warning of potential threats to public health and program monitoring (disease-specific or multi-disease). Response activities vary according to the threat in question, but must be evidence-based and timely.</p><p>These tools generally contain policies regarding the ability of the national government to take over a facility, the equipment or supplies needed during an outbreak, and the means with which the impacted organization would be compensated. These tools should be accessible and up to date, ensuring that they allow prompt and effective detection and mitigation.</p><p>Surveillance instruments ought to detail critical information such as the agreed list of priority diseases, partnerships with relevant stakeholders, and communication mechanisms between health facilities such as public health and/or animal laboratories and hospitals. Prompt, accurate detection of an outbreak relies on the quality of surveillance. When preparing for an outbreak, the response team may evaluate the surveillance instruments (system in place, use of electronic tools, analytical capacity, etc.) and identify gaps in the information they contain. Often, responders find a tiered score useful in guiding necessary changes to existing instruments. Surveillance of sustainable capacity receives the highest score through meeting specified criteria for its indicators.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup> Indicator types include input, process, output, outcome, and impact. They should be selected according to policy relevance, simplicity, sensitivity, and time-series information (if available). It is critical to maintain evaluation frameworks for tools to ensure that they can quickly and correctly identify an outbreak. Of note, the response team should set expectations of a functioning surveillance system in their preparedness plan that promote detection, communication, and collaboration in the initial identification of and response to an outbreak.</p><p>Response instruments cover the policy, strategy, and/or plan for responding to a detected threat. This may entail joint plans across relevant sectors, historical information on mitigation of earlier threats, guidelines for the establishment of interagency response teams, and analysis of the country’s response capacity. These tools enable strategic risk assessments to prioritize threats and determine appropriate management responses. Similar to surveillance, indicators can be evaluated based on set criteria to determine a country’s capacity for response. Response resources include expertise, staff, logistics, equipment, finance, and facilities, and their appropriate use relies on useful guidance for response to a threat. Effective, prompt response relies on rapid, precise mobilization of resources, underscoring the importance of a clear plan and sufficient supplies.</p><p>Public health surveillance and response are intended to keep outbreaks in check through effective detection and action.

The first step in generating a hypothesis is typically reviewing the preliminary data collected from interviews with case-patients and recorded in line listing.

By looking for patterns, differences, and commonalities among responses, investigators can build a hypothesis about the cause, source, or mode of transmission.</p><p>Another step in generating an epidemiologic hypothesis during outbreak investigation involves a literature review. It can provide valuable insight into potential causative agents, risk factors or sources exposures observed during past outbreaks.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> Understanding the biology of the disease by looking at general information on pathogenic organisms and outbreaks “possible modes of transmission, whether there are animal reservoirs of disease, and the length of its incubation and infectious periods”<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup> is a valuable to making an informed hypothesis. Literature reviews can be conducted online by looking at morbidity and mortality reports, disease control and prevention center websites, or academic publication searches. It is important to note however, that outbreaks can be caused by unknown causative agents or modes of transmission.

Steps include creation of a strategy and framework for stakeholder communication, development and vetting of standard messages for issues common to crises, training of communications personnel, and creation of a system for rapid message review and approval. At an outbreak’s onset, development of the specific communication strategy must be started to promptly allocate responsibilities, designate message content, and identify areas for coordination. Stakeholder duties can be determined by identifying and designating domains of expertise. Senior management and political leadership can reach consensus on delegation of responsibilities to inform outreach efforts, ensuring that relevant entities are incorporated and the communication serves its purpose.</p><p>The location of the outbreak influences how responsibilities are delegated. If the outbreak is subnational or national, federal, state, and/or local entities will play specific roles in communication with the public. Ensure that political representatives and their staff will have adequate support and timely, accurate information. If international, the country’s ministry of health will determine the most appropriate communication strategy. Internationally, the American field investigator and, if possible, health communications specialist will work to promote effective collaboration.</p><p>The strategy should reflect situational awareness of the outbreak, and acknowledge the heterogeneity of stakeholders. Primary, secondary, and tertiary audiences must be identified. Secondary audiences influence primary actors directly, and tertiary audiences influence secondary actors in decision-making processes by promoting protective norms at the community level. In identifying the target audience(s) and messaging content, factors to consider include: <sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup></p><p><ul><li>Who are or could be affected?</li> <li>Which behavioral factors leave individuals particularly vulnerable?</li> <li>Which stakeholders could most effectively reach affected persons or populations?</li> <li>What community perceptions could affect communications?</li> <li>How can the public be provided specific, clear, actionable steps?</li> <li>What will partner communication coordination need to entail?</li></ul></p><p>The strategy should contain information on message development to guide the accurate translation of outbreak information into useful tools for risk assessment, self-protection, and identification of next steps. Messages can be broadened or tailored depending on their content and target population. If messages aim to inspire behavior change, positive communication will prove more effective. This commitment to sharing information appropriately and effectively facilitates communication that promotes trust among all parties.</p><p>The strategy must outline communication logistics to allow for the timely, clear delivery of important information during an outbreak.

EC note: ""this activity is repeated in SAFETY under “Attribution Investigation.” While the literature says that chain of custody should be implemented once there is suspicion of a crime, I wonder if the chain should be in place before that; waiting until there is a suspicion of a crime will be too late for a lot of the samples collected absent chain of custody. Is it standard practice for chain of custody to be in place for any epi investigation? Should it be? We could add a statement like, “Even absent a criminal investigation, chain of custody is good practice for any epidemiological investigation to enable any problems that may have occurred along the way (e.g., sample misidentification, delivery delays, breach in cold chain) to be identified and prevented in the future.""

Timely information exchange informs effective public health decisions, is essential for taking action, and is really the main function of the EOC.</p><p>The availability of technology will impact the efficiency with which information is shared. At a basic level, EOCs should at least contain telephones and fax machines with secure connection capabilities; video teleconferencing and computer messaging systems should also ideally be the norm. All EOCs should have certain standard components, among which are communication systems and backup electrical and heating/air conditioning systems that can help support and maintain these systems.</p><p>Ultimately, a wide range of information and communications technology (ICT), software and hardware components, and systems that support EOC functions is available to allow EOCs to collect, analyze, interpret, visualize, and disseminate information. ICT should be interoperable, reliable, modifiable, and supported by backups. Lack of interoperability is a major challenge for the technology used in EOCs; interoperability is supported through a common terminology shared among the system’s elements. Backup systems, redundancy, and security requirements are also critical for ensuring that EOCs remain functional even if initial systems glitch or fail.</p><p>Knowledge management systems are a way to organize information coming into an EOC, thereby enabling increased and improved information exchange from the EOC back out to other stakeholders.

These protocols should be developed in advance, and modified as needed in an emergency to address the particular circumstances of an outbreak. The following discussion outlines some key elements that should be considered as part of these plans; the references cited provide significantly more detail that can aid the establishment of comprehensive plans.</p><em>Collection</em><p>The initial investigation involves both the collection of information on suspect cases and the collection of clinical samples to enable laboratory diagnosis.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup> The type of sample collected depends on the nature of the outbreak and should be taken from suspected cases as soon as possible once an outbreak has been identified. Biological samples typically include blood, urine, saliva, feces, etc.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> They are typically collected from people but can also be collected from animals when investigators suspect a zoonotic outbreak. (Environmental specimens such as from food, water, and fomites may also be relevant and may be collected during disease outbreak investigations to confirm the source of an infectious agent; environmental samples are frequently collected in conjunction with human clinical samples.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup> )</p><p>Appropriate sample collection is important to ensure sample quality and quantity for sufficient laboratory use. Key steps to ensuring that appropriate samples are collected and with the correct procedures include:<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""4"">4</sup></p><p><ul><li>Deciding which clinical specimens are required to confirm the cause of the outbreak </li> <li>Selecting the laboratory for specimen testing</li> <li>Deciding who will collect, process and transport the specimens </li> <li>Defining the procedures necessary for specimen management </li></ul></p><p>There are obviously many details to consider among these steps, including ensuring the safety of the specimen collector; implementing a labeling schema that all parties understand; and ensuring the needed packaging materials are brought to the specimen collection site. Sample collection equipment, transport mediums, and personal protective equipment are important for secure sample collection and should follow standard operating procedure guidance. Once collected, samples should be labeled with a unique identifier to link to patient demographic and/or epidemiological information, as appropriate.</p><em>Transport</em><p>The epidemiological investigation may be conducted in a site remote from the laboratory which will receive and process the sample, making advance planning necessary for all aspects of the flow of diagnostic specimens, from patient through to laboratory.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""5"">5</sup> As part of the emergency planning process, consideration should be given to sample storage, packaging, and transport.</p><p>Before transport, the collection team should notify the receiving laboratory of all shipping and sample details. Initial surface transportation of samples from field sites to transport facilities may be required prior to shipment to processing laboratories. If international transport is necessary, authorization to import the specimens should be organized by the laboratory.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""6"">6</sup> Different transportation methods will necessitate different packaging and processes:<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""7"">7</sup></p><p><ul><li>Surface transport/courier: Transport boxes should be securely fastened in place in the transport vehicle, and a spill kit should be present in the vehicle. An adequate amount of refrigerant should be available in case of delays. Extensive vibration of samples should be avoided if possible as it can hemolyze or otherwise damage samples. Ideally, serum should be separated from clotted blood samples before transport. </li> <li>Air transport/postal service: Samples may be sent by mail in conformance with relevant international, national, and commercial carrier requirements. Contact with postal authorities should be established prior to the collection of samples to ensure their ability to transport the materials and to verify shipping requirements. There are commercial organizations specializing in transport of clinical samples and infectious materials, and they can provide details of their sample packaging and documentation requirements.</li></ul></p><p>This guidance will support an attribution investigation as it supports an epidemiological investigation and laboratory analysis; for attribution purposes, however, planners may wish to pay particular attention to biosecurity planning elements, which will be especially important for ensuring evidence integrity during a criminal investigation.</p>","Fink Handbook of Epidemiology,UNC Collecting specimens in outbreaks,WHO Guidelines for collection of clinical specimens","Intervention,Surveillance & preparedness,Detection,Early response",,"Courier and transportation services,World Health Organization,Health authorities,Commerce authorities,Animal health authorities,Private sector organizations,World Organization for Animal Health,Environmental protection authorities,Local NGOs,International NGOs,Private sector laboratories,Commercial airlines","Health authorities,Animal health authorities,Medical and clinical care organizations,World Health Organization,World Organization for Animal Health,Environmental protection authorities,Commercial airlines,Courier and transportation services,Commerce authorities,Private sector laboratories,Local NGOs,International NGOs","Health authorities,Animal health authorities,Medical and clinical care organizations,Security authorities,Private sector laboratories,Courier and transportation services,Environmental protection authorities,Commercial airlines",,"Preparedness,Biosafety and biosecurity,Real-time surveillance,National laboratory system","Logistics,Health","Surveillance and contact tracing,Operational readiness,Laboratory testing","Zoonotic,Animal-only,Human-only","Permissive,Non-permissive","Subnational,National,International","Unknown origin,Deliberate,Natural,Accidental","Localized syndromic event (e.g. a cluster of encephalitis with no known causative agent),Localized exposure (environmental / foodborne / waterborne / poisonings / pollutants),Zoonotic spillover without known onward transmission,Zoonotic spillover with human-to-human transmission* (*with repeated reintroduction),Vector-borne transmission without known onward transmission,Vector-borne transmission with human-to-human transmission* (*vector-mediated),Vector-borne transmission with human-to-human transmission* (*human-mediated),Human pathogen with environmental transmission* (non-respiratory e.g. water-borne pathogens),Human pathogen with respiratory transmission* (*including for example historical point-source zoonotic origin),Human pathogen with transmission through bodily fluids",International Shipment of Zika Samples from Brazil,,No media links identified,"Collect biological and environmental samples,Transport samples domestically,Transport samples internationally,Ensure chain of custody of samples",,,removed local NGOs

While epidemiological data are owned by the countries in which they are generated, the WHO consensus is that they should be shared by default (with an opt-out policy). Notification requirements of the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) are based on the identification within a States Party territory of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal is to capture any novel or evolving risk to international public health, taking into account the context in which the event occurs.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> The regulations ask States Parties to share information with WHO <em>before</em> WHO declares a PHEIC. WHO can in turn make that information available to the public once certain requirements are met (such as declaration of a PHEIC or an immediate need for international control measures). </li> <li><strong>Genetic sequence data/information</strong>. Sharing of sequence data allows improved tracking of epidemics and aids in the development of diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines. WHO asks that genome sequences be made publicly available as quickly as possible through relevant databases, and that benefits arising from the use of those sequences be shared equitably with the country from where the pathogen genome sequence originates. </li> <li><strong>Observational studies and clinical trials</strong>. The most important element of information sharing with respect to observational and clinical trial studies is a) that they are being carried out and b) when results are expected. Once data are available and able to be shared (based on predefined disclosure allowances for these kinds of studies), those carrying out such studies should work with researchers, funders, and journals to ensure preliminary and final results are quickly made available. It is WHO policy that all interventional clinical trials be prospectively registered in a primary clinical trials registry that conforms to standards agreed to by the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (who.int/ictrp). </li></ul></p><p>Countries should develop protocols with consideration for handling these kinds of data and information.

This is a critical duty to ensure safe, respectful burials that do not further spread the disease and honor the wishes and values of the family/loved ones. Protocols and practices for the identification, retrieval, and transport of human bodies may vary based on the details of the outbreak. However, certain steps and expectations are generally applicable.</p><p><strong>Identify Bodies</strong></p><p>To identify dead bodies, information from the deceased (e.g. physical features, clothes) is matched with information on missing person and/or presumed dead. Visual recognition of cadavers or their photographs by acquaintances of the deceased is the simplest means of connecting this information. However, this approach is error prone and ideally should be augmented by forensic identification (e.g. autopsies, fingerprinting, dental examinations).</p><p>The key steps of identification are:</p><p><ul><li>Assignment of unique reference number to each body/body part</li> <li>Labeling of body/body part and its container</li> <li>Photograph of body/body part (be sure to include unique reference number)</li> <li>Recording of identifying data with reference number<ol><li>Gender</li><li>Approximate age range</li><li>Personal belongings</li><li>Obvious specific marks on skin/deformity</li><li>If no photograph is taken, also record race, height, color and length of hair, color of eyes.</li></ol></li> <li>Secure packaging and storage of personal belongings with the body/body part<ol><li>Be sure to leave clothing on the body.</li></ol></li></ul></p><p>When releasing the body to relatives, identification must be certain and visual recognition confirmed by additional information. Bodies should only be released by the ‘responsible authority’ along with documentation of the release (using a letter or death certificate). The name and contact information of the person or relatives who claim the body should be recorded.</p><p>Other important considerations include</p><p><ul><li>Recovery, documentation, and storage of the dead play a critical role in the success of identifying bodies. </li> <li>The SOP for burials may include a Dead Bodies Identification form that may be used to collect basic information to then inform later forensic identification procedures.</li> <li>Evaluation of a combination of criteria, rather than solely visual recognition, can help avoid distressing, embarrassing mistaken identification. </li> <li>Separate body parts that prove a person is dead can help with identification. As such, they should be managed as a whole body (by assigning unique reference number).</li></ul></p><p><strong>Retrieve and Transport Human Remains</strong></p><p>Rapid retrieval is highly important, for it assists with identification and ameliorates the psychological burden faced by survivors. Of note, recovery should not interrupt interventions intended to help survivors.</p><p>Bodies should be stored in body bags or alternative options if not available, and parts should be treated as individual bodies. Teams are most effective at recovery when split into two groups, one to transport to a nearby collection point and another to take them to identification and/or storage areas. Health and safety practices in accordance with the SOP must be followed throughout retrieval and transport.</p><p>Key steps for transportation include:</p><p><ul><li>Identification of patient (e.g. toe tags, infectious substance tags) </li> <li>Notification of mortuary regarding relevant information (e.g. body has implanted electronic medical device)</li> <li>Transport from hospital/other point of origin to pre-identified transportation (e.g. hearse)</li> <li>Transport via pre-identified transportation to pre-identified place of final disposition</li></ul></p><p>Appropriate tools for transport include stretchers, body bags, and flat-bed trucks or tractor-trailers. Ideally, ambulances should be reserved for transporting the living. As well, aircrafts should not be used for transporting noncremated remains. The response team should also make logistical arrangements for the transportation route, including local transport for mortuary care or burial, with relevant authorities (local and/or state) in advance.

To ensure robust early warning and prompt response, the IDSR data collection and analysis system relies on two main channels of information or signal generation: Indicator-based surveillance (IBS); and event-based surveillance (EBS).” </em><p>The benefit of an integrated approach are that it offers efficiencies through its combining resources to collect, manage, and analyze information at a single focal point at each level.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> This, in turn, enables the generation of more complete information—true <em>epidemic intelligence</em> —to inform proper response.

Data may be reported and aggregated manually or, ideally, electronically. This physical aggregation of data from different reporting streams forms the basis of being able to create a dataset that integrates IBS and EBS.</p><p>Once integrated, surveillance data enable decision-makers to determine courses of action that can best prevent, contain, and mitigate outbreaks. Analysis should be undertaken with this end goal in mind. Data should be analyzed regularly and published, either in regularly timed reports and/or in the scientific literature.

In these cases, the federal government provides clear criteria to guide decision-making and conducts outreach with state and local entities to inform a cohesive national strategy.</p><p>Once an outbreak is detected, health and transportation leaders should determine the existence and location of potential threats to the secure transportation of patients and supplies. With this in mind, the outbreak plan can guide the implementation of alternative transportation solutions such as clearing or maintaining necessary roads and infrastructure.

An outbreak may cause disruptions in food supply due to changes in personnel, protocol, and need. As such, the supply chain must be closely monitored.</p><p>Food inputs are challenged by outbreaks. During an epidemic, restrictions on movement may lead to worker shortages. This leaves produce unharvested and critical food left to rot in the fields.

These decisions are particularly important if data activities are to be implemented in multiple locations. Plans should also acknowledge how and when regular, timely data summaries will be disseminated. Flexible, interoperable data platforms and adequate, well-trained staff are critical to effective outbreak management.</p><p>Data for management in an outbreak includes, but is not limited to, case data. Field investigators may also need to manage other information stored in different systems, calling for sufficient access and adequate technology for aggregation. Specific examples of non-case data include current and projected need for laboratory materials, turnaround time from receipt of specimen to results’ availability, and school and workplace attendance and closures.</p><p>Technologies for data management include both electronic tools such as computers, software applications, and mobile devices used to collect, store, and analyze data. Common software for data management and analysis include SAS, SPSS, and R. Social media may be used as well.</p><p>Technologies also comprise organizational methods such as public health surveillance systems, ongoing public health databases, purpose-built databases for specific investigations, and other means of storing, managing, querying, and sharing data among devices/databases.</p><p>The main goals of technology in data management are to streamline and directly support field investigations, giving epidemiologists and laboratorians adequate time to carry out their duties. Technology platforms may be selected by factors such as the investigation’s goals, the training and skills of the staff, available technical infrastructure, and the speed and frequency with which summaries/reports are needed. As the outbreak evolves, the response team should be prepared to review selected technologies and systems to adjust as needed.</p><p>Location of data management depends on the outbreak. Some responses opt to manage findings in the field, while others rely on management and analysis off-site. For off-site management, response teams are able to avoid spending additional resources toward an on-site data management team but they must have adequate, high-quality technology to share data with relevant staff.</p><p>Specialized data management staff must be employed, either on location or remotely. This is particularly important, for field investigations are often led by individuals with largely epidemiologic, disease, and scientific knowledge bases. This expertise in leadership underscores the value of hiring a chief data scientist or chief surveillance and informatics officer at the start of the response. Duties of this individual may include coordinating the full range of data collection and management of the response; maintaining familiarity with surveillance systems, protocols, infrastructure, etc.; identifying if and when existing data management systems should be modified; and meeting regularly with response staff to ensure that activities of data collection and management are aligned with needs of the evolving response. If possible, staff should rely on little in-event training, avoiding a bottleneck with the data management response.</p><p>When packing for field deployments, response staff must bring necessary equipment for secure, effective data management. Specific technology items include a computer, mobile hot spot, and/or a smart phone.

Volunteers can be drawn from all aspects of society but are considered most effective when working in their own communities; since 2000, the use of volunteers to improve community uptake and acceptance of health interventions has been a core tenet of Red Cross/Red Crescent efforts, particularly in Africa.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> To date, national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies maintain a network of volunteers that can be activated to support health activities, including outbreak response when provided with the appropriate training.</p><p>The IFRC has developed training materials for volunteers involved in epidemic response.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup> These materials have been successfully adapted, translated, and implemented in many outbreak response settings, including for cholera outbreak responses in Zimbabwe and Haiti.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""4"">4</sup> Specific disease outbreaks may require additional specialized trainings. For example, responding to outbreaks of high risk pathogens may require training on the use of personal protective equipment, infection prevention and control measures, and safe and dignified burials, as well as the measures and approaches that can be used to communicate about these practices to affected communities in an appropriate, accurate, and sensitive way.</p><p>While volunteers are most likely to be mobilized in the early stages of the outbreak, and can continue working throughout the intervention stages, their role in preparedness as well as post-intervention and recovery should not be neglected. Volunteer training, for example, should take place as much as possible prior to epidemic alerts, to ensure rapid mobilization of already-trained volunteers can take place. Volunteers can also be vaccinated against common forms of illness, particularly ahead of any known seasonal increases in incidence. Volunteers are also increasingly being integrated into community based surveillance programs, to provide early alerts of possible disease events.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""5"">5</sup> During the recovery period, volunteers can assist with strengthening community health care and prevention. Volunteers may also require their own psychosocial support, as well as assistance with re-integration back into their communities after an epidemic response.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""6"">6</sup> For example, after the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola response, Red Cross volunteers, many of whom had been involved in supporting safe and dignified burial practices, were often stigmatized by their communities.

Resource mapping for vaccination capacity can help inform outbreak preparedness planning and implementation. <strong> </strong> Resource mapping allows countries to assess what is available to them, cost the activities in their plan, and consider logistical aspects of ensuring these resources reach their intended target.</p><p>Authorities must first determine their current capacity for vaccine delivery, and delivery within a certain timeframe. They should then assess the gap between existing resources and capabilities, and potential need during an outbreak. Planners should consider the capacities of warehouses to receive and store vaccine.

To do this, they must be outfitted with a variety of supplies, both specialized and general, that enable testing.</p><p>Basic inventory management practices can support a laboratory that is ready to receive and process samples during an outbreak. Establishing a purchasing and inventory management program helps ensure that supplies, including reagents, are available when needed; that high quality supplies are obtained at fair cost; and that supplies are not lost to improper storage or used beyond their expiry.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup> The World Health Organization provides detailed guidance on how laboratories can implement inventory control.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup></p><p>Practicing good inventory management will help ensure that at least some of the more general supplies—such as personal protective equipment, extraction reagents, pipettes, reaction tubes—are available at the onset of an outbreak. Of course, the particular nature of the outbreak—the offending pathogen and the volume of samples, for instance—will dictate what supplies and how many of them will be needed to successfully navigate sample receipt through storage. In general, supplies should address needed materials at each step of the samples lifecycle within the laboratory:</p><p><ul><li>Receipt</li> <li>Temporary storage</li> <li>Processing</li> <li>Testing</li> <li>Analyzing</li> <li>Medium- and long-term storage</li> <li>Shipping to another testing site (potential)</li></ul></p><p>Supplies needed across this lifecycle will support testing capacity as well as safety, security, and accuracy of analysis. It may be helpful for planning to consider two categories, generic and specific, and to acquire more generic supplies in advance (so long as inventory can be kept properly stored and updated to avoid expiration). Generic supplies include items like documentation materials (e.g., adhesive labels, permanent marker); personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, masks, gowns, goggles); temporary cold chain support (e.g., coolers, dry ice); and some non-specific test reagents like DNA/RNA extractives. Specific supplies will include the material needed to address the particular pathogen in question, such as diagnostic testing kits and/or testing reagents. Planners developing their inventories should also consider a review of the laboratory’s necessary equipment inventory, such as computers for analysis and items for long-term storage support (e.g., freezers at –20°C/–80°C/–140°C, reliable electricity/generators).</p><p>The required supplies can be procured from national or international sources. Many private companies manufacture these supplies, especially the more general supplies. Diagnostic tests and test kits will often be made available through the central government or its bilateral/multilateral partners, and sometimes from academic laboratories. Private companies may also develop test reagents and kits. Methods for obtaining reagents and supplies vary considerably between laboratories, with some laboratories purchasing directly, whereas in many countries a national procurement system is in place with a central stores area that distributes directly to the laboratories.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup> Sometimes donors play a major role in the procurement of supplies and reagents, both during the preparedness phase and during outbreaks.</p><p>The International Reagent Resource is an entity established by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a centralized source of reagents, tools, and information for public health laboratories around the world studying and detecting influenza virus.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""4"">4</sup> The IRR can therefore support laboratories that need to build their reagent inventory for influenza specifically (although during the COVID-19 outbreak, the organization also made reagents available to the 50 United States and its territories).</p><p>Supplies can be replenished and/or modified to meet the particular needs of the outbreak.

Collaborations should be intersectoral, bringing together health and non-health agencies to deliver needed services. Mental health services can be embedded in general health services or in other pre-existing structures such as school, community centers, etc. Mental health specialists can provide training, supervision, and support to primary health care workers to successfully integrate mental health care into general health.

Rapid sharing of data and information can help inform all stakeholders about new outbreak developments, and speed the identification implementation of appropriate mitigation measures.</p><p>The development of protocols for sharing epidemiological data helps provide advance clarity on expected methods for the timely sharing of data to and from public and private institutions. Countries should develop protocols in advance for how these kinds of data and information will be summarized and by what channels they will be shared with designated recipients. The WHO describes three kinds of data that are typically provided to the WHO; the same information can and should be shared with national and sub-national partners as well:<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup></p><p><ul><li><strong>Surveillance, epidemiology, and emergency response</strong>. Written summaries of surveillance and epidemiology findings provided to a country’s stakeholders (from local responders to national government) enable all parties to work from the same basis of information, enabling a more coordinated, multi-sectoral response. At the international level, notification requirements of the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) are based on the identification within a States Party territory of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC); the goal is to capture any novel or evolving risk to international public health.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> </li> <li><strong>Genetic sequence data/information</strong>. Sharing of sequence data allows improved tracking of epidemics and aids in the development of diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines. WHO asks that genome sequences be made publicly available as quickly as possible through relevant databases, and that benefits arising from the use of those sequences be shared equitably with the country from where the pathogen genome sequence originates. </li> <li><strong>Observational studies and clinical trials</strong>. Stakeholders should be informed of any relevant studies and trials being carried out and when results are expected. Once data are available and able to be shared, those carrying out such studies should work with researchers, funders, and journals to ensure preliminary and final results are quickly made available. It is WHO policy that all interventional clinical trials be prospectively registered in a primary clinical trials registry.</li></ul></p><p>Ultimately, outbreak data should be published in peer reviewed manuscripts to contribute to the broader scientific understanding of the pathogen or disease process. It is becoming more commonplace for authors or journals to publish such pieces as “pre-prints,” which are articles that have not yet completed peer review and other elements of the formal publication process. This became very common practice during COVID-19 to ensure that the scientific and decision-making communities were kept as up to date as possible. This approach is not without tradeoffs, as the information presented may not be accurate or complete, but is a consideration when time is of the essence.</p>","WHO IHR Brief No.2,WHO Policy Statement on Data Sharing","Surveillance & preparedness,Detection,Early response,Intervention,Post-intervention & recovery",,"Animal health authorities,Health authorities,Academic researchers,World Organization for Animal Health,World Health Organization,Private sector organizations,Local NGOs","Animal health authorities,Health authorities,Academic researchers,World Organization for Animal Health,World Health Organization,Private sector organizations,Local NGOs","Animal health authorities,Health authorities,Academic researchers,World Organization for Animal Health,World Health Organization,Private sector organizations,Local NGOs",,Reporting,Health,"Laboratory testing,Research response including vaccinations,Case management and infection prevention and control","Zoonotic,Human-only,Animal-only","Permissive,Non-permissive","Subnational,National,International","Accidental,Deliberate,Unknown origin,Natural","Localized syndromic event (e.g. a cluster of encephalitis with no known causative agent),Localized exposure (environmental / foodborne / waterborne / poisonings / pollutants),Zoonotic spillover without known onward transmission,Zoonotic spillover with human-to-human transmission* (*with repeated reintroduction),Vector-borne transmission without known onward transmission,Vector-borne transmission with human-to-human transmission* (*vector-mediated),Vector-borne transmission with human-to-human transmission* (*human-mediated),Human pathogen with environmental transmission* (non-respiratory e.g. water-borne pathogens),Human pathogen with respiratory transmission* (*including for example historical point-source zoonotic origin),Human pathogen with transmission through bodily fluids",International Shipment of Zika Samples from Brazil,,,,"Website does not show coded Phases

There should be adequate infection and prevention control (IPC) and PPE supplies. They should receive any available and relevant vaccinations prior to deployment. They also need accurate, pertinent, timely information, instruction, and training on their safety and health and the services they are providing. For example, staff should know how to use, put on, take off, and dispose of personal protective equipment (PPE). They should also be familiar with self-assessment and staying home when ill. As well, staff should receive technical updates on new developments with the outbreak, and have access to appropriate tools for the assessment, triage, testing, and treatment of patients.</p><p>As well, responders should feel heard, supported, and valued as critical members of the response team. An accessible, reliable communication channel between leadership and responders can foster trust and allow for an understanding of events on the ground and adjustments to the response as needed. If possible and appropriate, responders should have access to mental health and counseling resources.</p><p>Responders may remove themselves from situations they deem to pose imminent and serious danger to their life or health, and be protected from consequences for this decision.

Among other areas, plans should be in place that identify procedures and decision-making related to sending and receiving health personnel; address regulatory and licensure concerns of requesting/accepting and receiving health personnel from an international source; and identify training criteria and standards for health personnel who will be sent or received. Working through the technical questions of the JEE (D4.2 and R4.2) will aid in preparation.</p><p>If a general quarantine is in effect and public transportation is reduced or eliminated, this will impact essential workers’ ability to reach sites of care. Officials must have plans and policies in place that enable these personnel to reach outbreak sites. This may involve making public transport available just for essential workers, and/or developing agreements with private carriers. One way for groups of personnel, including healthcare workers, to reach a site in need is via convoy or caravan, a group of vehicles traveling together for the sake of convenience or safety. While individual vehicles can move faster and organizing a caravan takes time and planning, convoys may make sense when long distances or dangerous conditions warrant it.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup> Air transport may be the fastest or only way to move personnel from one part of the country to another, or across borders.</p><p>Personnel deployment is a key activity that cross-border agreements can be used to support.

In infectious disease outbreaks, epidemiologists help to reveal the features of the pathogen’s movement through a population, information that can then be used toward containment and mitigation. This process of gathering epidemiologic data and information and applying it to infectious disease outbreaks is often termed “epidemic intelligence.”</p><p>The objective of epidemic intelligence is to provide timely and actionable information about outbreaks; its components include:<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup></p><p><ul><li>Screening</li> <li>Filtering</li> <li>Validating</li> <li>Analyzing</li> <li>Assessing</li> <li>Communicating and documenting</li></ul></p><p>Epidemic intelligence training should occur at all levels of administration, from local to national to international. Epidemiologists operate at each of these levels of government. This training can be achieved through graduate study, continuing education for ministry employees, or programs like Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP). The training may depend on the particular role the individual is being trained for. Field epidemiologists, for instance, should be trained to collect, analyze and report outbreak data, including contract tracing methodologies. FETPs are helpful for building a skilled field workforce in that their training integrates theory with field assignments, providing a good forum for learning skills like interviewing, contact tracing, and sample taking. Other forms of training may cover surveillance techniques, descriptive studies, and statistical analysis. Epidemiologists should be prepared to provide expertise in response activities and in capacity-building for communicable disease surveillance and control.</p><p>Learning local, national, and international reporting procedures for epidemic intelligence is also a critical part of the training. For intelligence to be useful, it must be shared. The World Health Organization (WHO) is a consumer of the epidemic intelligence that countries produce and report, using that information to make decisions. The World Organization for Animal Health similarly requests epidemic intelligence on animal outbreaks, including zoonoses.</p><p>The following resources may be useful for countries wishing to develop or expand their trained epidemic intelligence workforce:</p><p><ul><li>TEPHINET (Training Programs in Epidemiology and Public Health Interventions Network) website<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup></li> <li>WHO, <em>Strengthening national capacities for epidemic preparedness and response in support to national implementation of IHR (2005)</em><sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup></li> <li>WHO distance learning resource webpage, including free courses<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""4"">4</sup></li> <li>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <em>Field Epidemiology Training Manual</em><sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""5"">5</sup></li> <li>U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention online epidemiology training materials<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""6"">6</sup></li></ul></p>","CDC Epidemiology Training & Resources,CDC Field Epidemiology Training Manual,ECDC Fem Wiki Epidemic Intelligence,WHO Courses of Study,WHO Strengthening National Capacities for Epidemic Preparedness,TEPHINET website","Detection,Early response,Surveillance & preparedness",,"Animal health authorities,World Health Organization,Environmental protection authorities,Health authorities,International NGOs,Academic researchers,World Organization for Animal Health","Health authorities,Animal health authorities,Environmental protection authorities,Local NGOs,World Health Organization,World Organization for Animal Health,Academic researchers,Medical and clinical care organizations","World Health Organization,World Organization for Animal Health,Health authorities,Animal health authorities,Local NGOs,Public health institutes,International NGOs,Environmental protection authorities,Transportation authorities,Academic researchers,Medical and clinical care organizations",,"Zoonotic disease,Real-time surveillance,Reporting",Health,"Surveillance and contact tracing,Operational readiness,Laboratory testing","Zoonotic,Animal-only,Human-only","Permissive,Non-permissive","Subnational,National,International","Unknown origin,Deliberate,Natural,Accidental","Localized syndromic event (e.g. a cluster of encephalitis with no known causative agent),Localized exposure (environmental / foodborne / waterborne / poisonings / pollutants),Zoonotic spillover without known onward transmission,Zoonotic spillover with human-to-human transmission* (*with repeated reintroduction),Vector-borne transmission without known onward transmission,Vector-borne transmission with human-to-human transmission* (*vector-mediated),Vector-borne transmission with human-to-human transmission* (*human-mediated),Human pathogen with environmental transmission* (non-respiratory e.g. water-borne pathogens),Human pathogen with respiratory transmission* (*including for example historical point-source zoonotic origin),Human pathogen with transmission through bodily fluids","Cholera Surveillance in the Greater Accra Region of Ghana,Field Epidemiology Training Program in Action – 2012 MERS-CoV in Jordan,Contact Tracing During the West African Ebola Outbreak",,,"Establish a Field Epidemiology Training Program,Define and document SOPs for surveillance and epidemic intelligence",,,"Not sure about academic researchers.

Interpretation is then the qualitative assessment of the significance of this information, by considering elements like seasonal, geographical and historical patterns, clinical or biological elements, and demographic information.</li> <li><strong>EBS</strong> data are 1) <em>filtered</em> and 2) <em>selected</em> for further inclusion. Filtering EBS data is necessary because the nature of the information collected is likely to reflect a high proportion of rumors and duplicates. Filtering thus consists of screening supplicates and identifying and discarding information not relevant to early warning. Selection is the sorting of information according to national priority criteria, such as for priority diseases or syndromes. Selection is the phase that has the greatest impact on the capacity of EBS to provide early detection and must be performed by epidemiologically-skilled personnel. </li></ul></p><p>All the data can then be viewed in aggregate and together lead to <em>signals</em> that can alert officials to an acute problem that requires prompt response.

International regulations for the transport of infectious substances are based upon the recommendations of the United Nations Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and are presented in the form of Model Regulations.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> (The World Organisation for Animal Health also provides guidance for the transport of animal samples, which are based on these same Model Regulations.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup> ) These regulations reflect international agreements with respect to air, rail, road, sea, and post transport.</p><p>Many of the considerations needed to achieve successful transport can be planned in advance.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""4"">4</sup> Planning: It is imperative that those involved—the <strong>sender</strong> , the <strong>carrier</strong> and the <strong>receiver</strong> —develop a good working relationship in order to provide for safe and expeditious transport of biological samples when the time comes. Training: All personnel involved in transport must undergo appropriate training; ideally this should occur in advance of outbreaks.</p><p>Detailed steps for sample transport are provided by the World Health Organization (WHO).<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""5"">5</sup> Major considerations include:</p><p><ul><li>Determine sample category. If the country is using the U.N. Model Regulations, determine if the substance is a <em>Category A</em> sample (capable of causing permanent disability, or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals) or <em>Category B</em> sample (anything else).<em> </em>This is a good process even if the Model Regulations are not the operating standard within the country.</li> <li>Prepare shipment for transport. Packaging, labelling, and documentation requirements depend on the sample category. Triple packaging should be used for all samples. The level of required biohazard labelling and documentation of dangerous goods will depend on the sample category. Corresponding import and export permits, including clear documentation of the recipient's address are needed, and recipients must be notified and prepared to receive materials, with appropriate security measures in place. </li> <li>Be prepared for spill clean-up. In the event of a spill or leakage at any point along the shipment, clean-up procedures detailed in the guidelines should be followed (e.g., wear gloves, cover the spill with cloth or paper towels, apply disinfectant, etc.).</li> <li>Be aware of incident reporting requirements. While no reports of infections resulting from transport-related exposures have been documented, senders, carriers, and receivers should be prepared to report any spill or other incident that could lead to a human or animal exposure.</li></ul></p><p>In-country laboratories may need to re-ship samples to an international laboratory for subsequent testing; in this case, having specimen referral plans in place that outline a formal structure for the referral and transport of diagnostic specimens can minimize transfer steps and facilitate rapid diagnosis and laboratory confirmation.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""6"">6</sup> Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs) should be considered wherever possible to clarify how materials can and cannot be used for research purposes by the recipient, whether materials can be passed to third parties, to clarify intellectual property rights, and plans for long-term storage.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""7"">7</sup></p>","Guidance on regulations for the Transport of Infectious Substances,Fink Handbook of Epidemiology,OIE Transport of biological materials,Standley national specimen referral in Guinea","Intervention,Surveillance & preparedness,Detection,Early response",,"Security authorities,Health authorities,Animal health authorities,Environmental protection authorities,Commerce authorities,Commercial airlines,Courier and transportation services,Transportation authorities,International NGOs,World Organization for Animal Health,World Health Organization","International NGOs,Health authorities,Commercial airlines,Courier and transportation services,Private sector laboratories,World Health Organization,World Organization for Animal Health,UN Humanitarian Air Service,Animal health authorities,Private sector organizations,Transportation authorities","Security authorities,Health authorities,Animal health authorities,Environmental protection authorities,Commerce authorities,Commercial airlines,Courier and transportation services,Transportation authorities,International NGOs,World Organization for Animal Health,World Health Organization",,"Points of entry,Biosafety and biosecurity,National laboratory system","Logistics,Health","Laboratory testing,Research response including vaccinations","Zoonotic,Animal-only,Human-only","Permissive,Non-permissive","Subnational,National,International","Unknown origin,Deliberate,Natural,Accidental","Localized syndromic event (e.g. a cluster of encephalitis with no known causative agent),Localized exposure (environmental / foodborne / waterborne / poisonings / pollutants),Zoonotic spillover without known onward transmission,Zoonotic spillover with human-to-human transmission* (*with repeated reintroduction),Vector-borne transmission without known onward transmission,Vector-borne transmission with human-to-human transmission* (*vector-mediated),Vector-borne transmission with human-to-human transmission* (*human-mediated),Human pathogen with environmental transmission* (non-respiratory e.g. water-borne pathogens),Human pathogen with respiratory transmission* (*including for example historical point-source zoonotic origin),Human pathogen with transmission through bodily fluids",International Shipment of Zika Samples from Brazil,"International Air Transport Association.

Clinicians are taught to assess patients in a way that enables them to reach a set of possible diagnoses that could explain a patient’s signs and symptoms. This process remains critically important when assessing patients during an outbreak, to ensure suspected cases are captured and non-outbreak-related cases do not burden the healthcare system.</p><p>Although care will need to be adapted to the circumstances and nature of the particular outbreak, healthcare providers will continue to rely on their fundamental training in triage, history taking, subjective and objective patient assessment, development of differential diagnoses, development and implementation of treatment plans, and medical record keeping. The use of differential diagnoses as a tool for critically thinking through a patient’s signs and symptoms will not be new to clinicians, and they should embed this tool in their assessment process during an outbreak as they would in any other situation. Differential diagnoses are simply a list of diseases that a patient could have based on the information generated<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup> at a fairly early point in the assessment process, primarily through history taking and physical examination. A rigorous history-taking that includes evaluating whether the patient had contact with known or suspected cases or had another risk interface that could have exposed him or her to infection will support the differential diagnosis process. Clinicians can make the most of the differential diagnosis tool by leveraging the clinical guidance and case definitions provided to them by health authorities.</p><p>Once a set of prioritized differential diagnoses is established, it should be used to inform next steps for the patients. This may include further questioning, observation, and testing.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> Clinicians will decide what diagnostic approach makes sense to enable them to rule out conditions on their list and rule in others. For a new disease, laboratory-based diagnostics to assess the presence of pathogen in a patient sample may not be immediately available. Ruling out other diseases on the list and adhering to the provided case definitions will help in this case. It may even be an astute clinician who first identifies an outbreak is occurring, by recognizing that none of the differential diagnoses generated are perfect matches for the patient’s presentation and test results.</p><p>When laboratory or point-of-care diagnostic assays do become available, guidance on their use (which patients should get the test, at which point in the timeline of exposure, etc.) should be followed. For some known infectious diseases, the WHO publishes “Disease Commodity Packages” that enable healthcare providers and preparedness planners to identify the critical medical supplies and consumables that are needed to save lives in an outbreak.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup> This can help providers identify the provisions they need to get their patients definitively diagnosed, such as consumables for sample collection and personal protective equipment.</p>","""Wagner Case Detection, Outbreak Detection, and Outbreak Characterization"",CDC URDO differential diagnosis,WHO Disease Commodity Packages","Detection,Intervention,Early response,Post-intervention & recovery",,"Medical and clinical care organizations,Private sector laboratories,Health authorities,World Health Organization,World Organization for Animal Health,Animal health authorities","Medical and clinical care organizations,Private sector laboratories,Health authorities,Animal health authorities","Medical and clinical care organizations,Private sector laboratories,Health authorities,World Health Organization,World Organization for Animal Health,Animal health authorities",,No specific IHR core capacity,Health,"Surveillance and contact tracing,Case management and infection prevention and control","Zoonotic,Animal-only,Human-only","Permissive,Non-permissive","Subnational,National,International","Unknown origin,Deliberate,Natural,Accidental","Localized syndromic event (e.g. a cluster of encephalitis with no known causative agent),Localized exposure (environmental / foodborne / waterborne / poisonings / pollutants),Zoonotic spillover without known onward transmission,Zoonotic spillover with human-to-human transmission* (*with repeated reintroduction),Vector-borne transmission without known onward transmission,Vector-borne transmission with human-to-human transmission* (*vector-mediated),Vector-borne transmission with human-to-human transmission* (*human-mediated),Human pathogen with environmental transmission* (non-respiratory e.g. water-borne pathogens),Human pathogen with respiratory transmission* (*including for example historical point-source zoonotic origin),Human pathogen with transmission through bodily fluids",,,No media links identified,,,,

Such agreements facilitate any number of activities that can advance health security. Indeed, the International Health Regulations (IHR) were put into effect for the purpose of mitigating cross-border health threats; cross-border agreements are an essential component of ensuring that the goals of the IHR are met.</p><p>During the preparedness phase, cross-border agreements should be created or updated. Countries may consider agreements with countries with which they share a border, countries in the region or on the continent, and others around the globe that may assist outbreak response in a variety of ways. Some of the cross-border activities may be undertaken voluntarily; others may enable countries to comply with mandates under the International Health Regulations. The establishment or updating of agreements may continue during an outbreak, and agreements may be modified after an outbreak based on lessons learned.</p><p>Examples of key activities that cross-border agreements can be used to support include:</p><p><ul><li><strong>Surveillance</strong>: Cross-border biosurveillance can enable improved biological intelligence. Agreed-upon cross-border surveillance systems at points of entry (or another mechanism of regularly sharing data and information between neighboring countries) is a positive indicator of surveillance readiness.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup></li> <li><strong>Personnel deployment</strong>: Another indicator of readiness is that countries have the necessary legal and regulatory processes and logistical plans to allow for rapid cross-border deployment and receipt of public health and medical personnel. Regional/international collaboration assists countries in overcoming the legal, logistical and regulatory challenges to deployment and receipt of such personnel.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> Visas, licensing, and customs duties are all items for consideration during this planning process.</li> <li><strong>Information sharing</strong>: Surveillance, epidemiology, and emergency response information relevant to outbreaks should be shared internationally by default, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup> WHO also asks that genome sequences be made publicly available as quickly as possible through relevant databases, and that benefits arising from the use of those sequences be shared equitably with the country from where the pathogen genome sequence originates. Countries should consider the kind of data and information they will be required to share, and the mechanisms for doing so, such that prompt sharing can occur during an emergency.</li> <li><strong>Sample sharing</strong>: International transport of biological samples may be necessary if in-country laboratory testing resources are insufficient. Other countries may also wish to sequence and otherwise analyze pathogen samples to support epidemiological investigation and medical countermeasure development. Agreements between and among countries and international laboratories for this purpose can be worked out in advance. The WHO is developing a guidance tool for Material Transfer Agreements to ensure the movement of samples is mutually agreed upon between the provider and recipient.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""4"">4</sup> </li> <li><strong>Medical countermeasure sharing</strong>: Some countries may wish to send or receive medical countermeasures to other countries to assist with outbreak response. While the availability of specific countermeasures for a given emerging disease may be limited or nonexistent, countries may still wish to work out good-faith agreements for these countermeasures in advance of their development; they may also determine mechanisms for sharing available generic drugs and medical supplies with countries in need.</li> <li><strong>Migration</strong>: The continued movement of people (legally or illegally) during an outbreak requires consideration, including for such elements as point of entry capacity development, and border health risk mitigation such as through strengthened surveillance. Organizations such as the U.N. International Organization for Migration can provide guidance for planning, coordinating, exercising, development of standard operating procedures, and other supportive activities.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""5"">5</sup></li></ul></p><p>While bilateral agreements between countries and the WHO have become common to facilitate activities like information sharing, regional coordination among groups of countries lags.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""6"">6</sup> Improved regional health security strengthening may be achieved through the promulgation and maintenance of regional cross-border agreements. Countries can leverage regional health organizations to support this purpose.</p>","IOM Migration Health Division,JEE Tool 2nd Edition,Hospedales Cross-Border Approach,WHO Policy Statement on Data Sharing,WHo R&D Blueprint - sharing biological samples","Intervention,Surveillance & preparedness,Post-intervention & recovery,Detection,Early response",,"Health authorities,Animal health authorities,World Health Organization,World Organization for Animal Health,International Organization For Migration,Economic organizations and development banks,Transportation authorities,International NGOs","Health authorities,Animal health authorities,Security authorities,Police and law enforcement organizations,Commerce authorities,Environmental protection authorities,World Organization for Animal Health,World Health Organization,Transportation authorities,Economic organizations and development banks","Health authorities,Animal health authorities,World Health Organization,World Organization for Animal Health,International Organization For Migration,Economic organizations and development banks,Transportation authorities,International NGOs",,"""IHR coordination, communication and advocacy"",Points of entry,Reporting,Medical countermeasures and personnel deployment","Logistics,Health",Operational readiness,"Zoonotic,Animal-only,Human-only","Permissive,Non-permissive","Subnational,National,International","Unknown origin,Deliberate,Natural,Accidental","Localized syndromic event (e.g. a cluster of encephalitis with no known causative agent),Zoonotic spillover without known onward transmission,Zoonotic spillover with human-to-human transmission* (*with repeated reintroduction),Vector-borne transmission without known onward transmission,Vector-borne transmission with human-to-human transmission* (*vector-mediated),Vector-borne transmission with human-to-human transmission* (*human-mediated),Human pathogen with environmental transmission* (non-respiratory e.g. water-borne pathogens),Human pathogen with respiratory transmission* (*including for example historical point-source zoonotic origin),Human pathogen with transmission through bodily fluids",,,,,The website also includes laboratory analysis under functions and epidemiology and lab analysis under categories,,
