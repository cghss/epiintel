The purpose of decontamination in the context of an outbreak of infectious disease is to clean these objects in order to reduce the risk of spread of the pathogen to people.</p><p>Decontamination is an important element of infection prevention and control. When done effectively, it can help limit pathogen transmission by reducing the burden of pathogen in the environment, especially the built environment. A variety of infrastructures and areas will require decontamination, including hospital facilities, isolation centers, burial sites, and homes.</p><p>It is first necessary to assess the nature and extent of infrastructure contamination. This assessment will be based on the best scientific information to date about the pathogen and how it spreads. Officials may wish to perform environmental sampling to assess pathogen presence and burden in particular areas and how well decontamination measures are working. Officials should determine which areas need to be cleaned, including building surfaces (e.g., floors, walls, counters, door handles), ventilation systems, or any other areas that could have been exposed to the pathogen based on the circumstances of how it arrived and how it spreads. Assessment should also consider vehicles such as ambulances or others used to transport infected or potentially infected patients. Evaluation should also be made of major elements within the infrastructure, such as beds, wheelchairs, and medical equipment.</p><p>Successful decontamination involves choosing the correct disinfectant and the appropriate cleaning methods. Maximum effectiveness from disinfection results from an initial, thorough removal of organic and inorganic materials in order to prevent these materials from interfering with decontamination effectiveness.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> This cleaning to remove visible soil can be accomplished manually or mechanically using detergents or enzymatic products. Next, disinfectants that may be available include alcohol, chlorine, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, iodophors, ortho-phthalaldehyde, peracetic acid, phenolics, and quaternary ammonium compounds. <em>Not all disinfectants will work against all pathogens</em> . Also, because these compounds can be caustic, care must be taken to ensure the health and safety of those using or otherwise exposed to them. In addition to disinfections, other processes might include pasteurization and the use of ultraviolet light.</p><p>It is crucial to choose a disinfectant based on the properties of the agent. <em> </em> General infection prevention and control measures that address decontamination of the built environment may help decontamination for a novel pathogen, but it will be important to follow the best evidence emerging about how well the pathogen in question is counteracted by disinfectants and procedures. Medical equipment should be disinfected according to the manufacturer's instructions, hospital policies, and appropriate new emerging information and guidance. (For medical devices, WHO provides specific guidance for decontamination and reprocessing.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup> )</p><p>Decontamination should not be done only once but should become routinized.

Assessment of surveillance systems,Surveillance and epidemic intelligence,Epidemiology & lab analysis,Surveillance & preparedness,"<p>Assessing a surveillance system is an on-going process that evaluates the overall effectiveness and accuracy in early detection of acute public health events, as well as the timeliness and effectiveness of the response to that event, with the aim of optimizing the utility of the system for public health action. Regular evaluation of the surveillance system, and making corresponding updates at all levels, is an attribute corresponding to level 5 capacity under indicator D.2.1 (Surveillance systems) in the IHR Joint External Evaluation tool.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup></p><p>A comprehensive assessment should include an evaluation of the existing system’s key indexes, listed below:</p><p><ul><li>Acceptability</li> <li>Completeness</li> <li>Flexibility of the existing system</li> <li>Representativeness</li> <li>Simplicity</li> <li>Timeliness</li> <li>Usefulness</li> <li>Sensitivity</li> <li>Specificity</li> <li>Positive predictive value</li></ul></p><p>Indicators based on these variables should be collected, directly or indirectly, over time to provide measures of performance, as well as change, in the system.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> While most of the above indicators are usually expressed as ratios, percentages, or other quantitative descriptors, it is also important to consider collection of qualitative data on the performance of the system, for example through stakeholder consultations and key informant interviews. These data are critical for ensuring that the surveillance system meets its desired objectives.  Additional benefits of performing routine assessments of the surveillance system include gathering data to use as an evidence-base to guide changes to the system or modifications to the system’s objectives; enabling more effective resource allocation; and providing a framework for understanding achievements as well as surveillance failures.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup> In this way, on-going assessment, as well as evaluation, of a surveillance system is a critical tool for ensuring its relevance to national health priorities, within the context of continuous improvement.</p><p>The data from the surveillance assessment should be used to perform a gap analysis. The gap analysis uses a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) approach to analyzing the existing surveillance system, taking into consideration the context of the country’s specific needs and priorities. Ideally, to prevent duplication of efforts and conserve resources, the gap analysis can draw on information derived from previous situation analyses or risk assessments to establish the country context. The gap analysis allows for the identification of key actions and resources needed to address identified gaps, and strengthen early detection and response to acute public health events.</p><p>A number of frameworks and guidelines have been developed to support national and sub-national monitoring and evaluation of surveillance systems, including from CDC and WHO. <sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""4"">4</sup><sup>,</sup><sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""5"">5</sup><sup>,</sup><sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""6"">6</sup></p>"

Ideally, samples should be collected prior to the administration of antivirals or antibiotics. The type of sample collected will depend on the suspected pathogen; to assess for the presence of a bloodborne pathogen, for instance, blood samples will be needed. The World Health Organization’s Disease Commodity Packages are a series of disease-specific data sheets that outline technical specifications for a dozen important infectious diseases, addressing areas such as the needed type of sample for diagnosis, collection vessel, and transport medium.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> Guidance for sample collection for foodborne outbreaks is also available.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup></p><p>Samples can be taken from humans or from animals when investigators suspect a zoonotic outbreak.

Sample collection equipment, transport media, and personal protective equipment (PPE) are needed for safe and effective sample collection and should follow standard operating procedure guidance for each kind of collection, as provided through academic training guidance or national accrediting bodies. Providers must take care to follow best practices so as to avoid transmitting the pathogen via healthcare-associated infection. This may be a challenge with an emerging disease that is as yet unknown or about which little is known, but where guidance is available, it should be followed.

While paper forms have been important historically and may still be used in cases where power or resources make digital collection a hardship, surveillance data should ideally be collected, managed, and analyzed using an electronic data management system. Such electronic tools can ensure standardization, easy analysis, and easy sharing. Because data may often be epidemiologic line data—i.e., lists of detailed information about every case or suspected case in an outbreak—the volume can be considerable, making a digital means of management almost requisite to ensure all data are properly captured and stored.

The committee should not be formed <em>ad hoc </em> at the outset of an emerging event but rather meet regularly, such as on a monthly or quarterly business, in order to be most effective at mitigating and rapidly responding to new threats. The inter-agency coordinating committee is often well placed to develop the national public health emergency response plan, incorporating input from all relevant sectors, and ensuring formalized mechanisms are established between the various stakeholders to ensure the timely and comprehensive sharing of information. At its outset, the inter-agency coordinating committee should also be authorized to make recommendations on specific problems, and ensure the ability—including adequate financial resources—the assign task forces or teams to address emerging threats.

Determine mode of transmission,"Epidemiological investigation, Attribution investigation","Epidemiology & lab analysis, Safety & security","Detection, Early response","<p>Investigators can use an epidemic curve and information about the infectious agent’s biology to make inferences about an outbreak’s most likely mode of transmission. A pathogen can be transmitted from reservoir to host in a number of ways, and these modes of transmission can be classified differently.</p><p>Mode of transmission may be direct or indirect. With direct transmission, the infectious agent is transferred from a reservoir to a susceptible host by direct contact or droplet spread. For direct contact, the agent is transmitted by physical contact between individuals through skin-to-skin contact, kissing, and sexual intercourse. Some kinds of direct transmission are site specific. Droplet spread of a pathogen to a new host refers to spray with relatively large, short-range aerosols produced by sneezing, coughing or talking.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup> For indirect transmission, the infectious agent is transferred by airborne, vehicle-borne or vector-borne (mechanical or biological) means. Airborne transmission involves dust and fine particles known as aerosols suspended in air to carry infectious agents. Vehicles which facilitate indirect transmission include food, water, biologic products, and fomites. A vehicle may passively carry a pathogen or may provide an environment in which the agent grows.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> Vector transmission occurs through mechanical and biological means.

Determine policy on mandatory screenings and/or testing,Governance and policy,Governance & coordination,"Surveillance & preparedness, Detection, Early response, Intervention","<p>Screening and/or testing for disease is a fundamental tool in public health and preventive medicine, serving as a critical means of controlling the spread of epidemics. Emergency response policies should acknowledge their value by providing clear, effective guidelines on this subject. Notably, identification of cases can allow for early and targeted treatment, protect against community transmission, and contribute to an informed understanding of the outbreak. However, individuals may not understand the value of screening. A mandatory testing program could be perceived as a threat against civil liberties<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup> rather than an essential component of addressing an outbreak.

When local data are not available, a health department may use rates from state or national data, or, alternatively, conduct a telephone survey of physicians to determine whether they are seeing more cases of the disease than usual. Finally, a survey of the community may be conducted to establish the background or historical level of disease.”</em><p>Other causes for a rise in cases or a perceived rise in cases procedures may explain an excess number of cases. These need to be investigated and ruled out.

Develop or update instruments governing public health surveillance and response,Governance and policy,Governance & coordination,Surveillance & preparedness,"<p>The emergency preparedness plan should include instruments governing public health surveillance and response. Surveillance refers to the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of outcome-specific data for planning, implementing, and evaluating public health policies and practices. In the context of outbreaks, the principal functions of the surveillance system are early warning of potential threats to public health and program monitoring (disease-specific or multi-disease). Response activities vary according to the threat in question, but must be evidence-based and timely.</p><p>These tools generally contain policies regarding the ability of the national government to take over a facility, the equipment or supplies needed during an outbreak, and the means with which the impacted organization would be compensated. These tools should be accessible and up to date, ensuring that they allow prompt and effective detection and mitigation.</p><p>Surveillance instruments ought to detail critical information such as the agreed list of priority diseases, partnerships with relevant stakeholders, and communication mechanisms between health facilities such as public health and/or animal laboratories and hospitals. Prompt, accurate detection of an outbreak relies on the quality of surveillance. When preparing for an outbreak, the response team may evaluate the surveillance instruments (system in place, use of electronic tools, analytical capacity, etc.) and identify gaps in the information they contain. Often, responders find a tiered score useful in guiding necessary changes to existing instruments. Surveillance of sustainable capacity receives the highest score through meeting specified criteria for its indicators.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup> Indicator types include input, process, output, outcome, and impact. They should be selected according to policy relevance, simplicity, sensitivity, and time-series information (if available). It is critical to maintain evaluation frameworks for tools to ensure that they can quickly and correctly identify an outbreak. Of note, the response team should set expectations of a functioning surveillance system in their preparedness plan that promote detection, communication, and collaboration in the initial identification of and response to an outbreak.</p><p>Response instruments cover the policy, strategy, and/or plan for responding to a detected threat. This may entail joint plans across relevant sectors, historical information on mitigation of earlier threats, guidelines for the establishment of interagency response teams, and analysis of the country’s response capacity. These tools enable strategic risk assessments to prioritize threats and determine appropriate management responses. Similar to surveillance, indicators can be evaluated based on set criteria to determine a country’s capacity for response. Response resources include expertise, staff, logistics, equipment, finance, and facilities, and their appropriate use relies on useful guidance for response to a threat. Effective, prompt response relies on rapid, precise mobilization of resources, underscoring the importance of a clear plan and sufficient supplies.</p><p>Public health surveillance and response are intended to keep outbreaks in check through effective detection and action. Surveillance and response instruments should be evaluated thoroughly and regularly to identify and address gaps in outbreak detection and mitigation.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup><sup>,</sup><sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup></p>"

While epidemiological data are owned by the countries in which they are generated, the WHO consensus is that they should be shared by default (with an opt-out policy). Notification requirements of the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) are based on the identification within a States Party territory of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The goal is to capture any novel or evolving risk to international public health, taking into account the context in which the event occurs.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> The regulations ask States Parties to share information with WHO <em>before</em> WHO declares a PHEIC. WHO can in turn make that information available to the public once certain requirements are met (such as declaration of a PHEIC or an immediate need for international control measures). </li> <li><strong>Genetic sequence data/information</strong>. Sharing of sequence data allows improved tracking of epidemics and aids in the development of diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines. WHO asks that genome sequences be made publicly available as quickly as possible through relevant databases, and that benefits arising from the use of those sequences be shared equitably with the country from where the pathogen genome sequence originates. </li> <li><strong>Observational studies and clinical trials</strong>. The most important element of information sharing with respect to observational and clinical trial studies is a) that they are being carried out and b) when results are expected. Once data are available and able to be shared (based on predefined disclosure allowances for these kinds of studies), those carrying out such studies should work with researchers, funders, and journals to ensure preliminary and final results are quickly made available. It is WHO policy that all interventional clinical trials be prospectively registered in a primary clinical trials registry that conforms to standards agreed to by the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (who.int/ictrp). </li></ul></p><p>Countries should develop protocols with consideration for handling these kinds of data and information.

Clinicians are taught to assess patients in a way that enables them to reach a set of possible diagnoses that could explain a patient’s signs and symptoms. This process remains critically important when assessing patients during an outbreak, to ensure suspected cases are captured and non-outbreak-related cases do not burden the healthcare system.</p><p>Although care will need to be adapted to the circumstances and nature of the particular outbreak, healthcare providers will continue to rely on their fundamental training in triage, history taking, subjective and objective patient assessment, development of differential diagnoses, development and implementation of treatment plans, and medical record keeping. The use of differential diagnoses as a tool for critically thinking through a patient’s signs and symptoms will not be new to clinicians, and they should embed this tool in their assessment process during an outbreak as they would in any other situation. Differential diagnoses are simply a list of diseases that a patient could have based on the information generated<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup> at a fairly early point in the assessment process, primarily through history taking and physical examination. A rigorous history-taking that includes evaluating whether the patient had contact with known or suspected cases or had another risk interface that could have exposed him or her to infection will support the differential diagnosis process. Clinicians can make the most of the differential diagnosis tool by leveraging the clinical guidance and case definitions provided to them by health authorities.</p><p>Once a set of prioritized differential diagnoses is established, it should be used to inform next steps for the patients.

This is a critical duty to ensure safe, respectful burials that do not further spread the disease and honor the wishes and values of the family/loved ones. Protocols and practices for the identification, retrieval, and transport of human bodies may vary based on the details of the outbreak. However, certain steps and expectations are generally applicable.</p><p><strong>Identify Bodies</strong></p><p>To identify dead bodies, information from the deceased (e.g. physical features, clothes) is matched with information on missing person and/or presumed dead. Visual recognition of cadavers or their photographs by acquaintances of the deceased is the simplest means of connecting this information. However, this approach is error prone and ideally should be augmented by forensic identification (e.g. autopsies, fingerprinting, dental examinations).</p><p>The key steps of identification are:</p><p><ul><li>Assignment of unique reference number to each body/body part</li> <li>Labeling of body/body part and its container</li> <li>Photograph of body/body part (be sure to include unique reference number)</li> <li>Recording of identifying data with reference number<ol><li>Gender</li><li>Approximate age range</li><li>Personal belongings</li><li>Obvious specific marks on skin/deformity</li><li>If no photograph is taken, also record race, height, color and length of hair, color of eyes.</li></ol></li> <li>Secure packaging and storage of personal belongings with the body/body part<ol><li>Be sure to leave clothing on the body.</li></ol></li></ul></p><p>When releasing the body to relatives, identification must be certain and visual recognition confirmed by additional information. Bodies should only be released by the ‘responsible authority’ along with documentation of the release (using a letter or death certificate). The name and contact information of the person or relatives who claim the body should be recorded.</p><p>Other important considerations include</p><p><ul><li>Recovery, documentation, and storage of the dead play a critical role in the success of identifying bodies. </li> <li>The SOP for burials may include a Dead Bodies Identification form that may be used to collect basic information to then inform later forensic identification procedures.</li> <li>Evaluation of a combination of criteria, rather than solely visual recognition, can help avoid distressing, embarrassing mistaken identification. </li> <li>Separate body parts that prove a person is dead can help with identification. As such, they should be managed as a whole body (by assigning unique reference number).</li></ul></p><p><strong>Retrieve and Transport Human Remains</strong></p><p>Rapid retrieval is highly important, for it assists with identification and ameliorates the psychological burden faced by survivors. Of note, recovery should not interrupt interventions intended to help survivors.</p><p>Bodies should be stored in body bags or alternative options if not available, and parts should be treated as individual bodies. Teams are most effective at recovery when split into two groups, one to transport to a nearby collection point and another to take them to identification and/or storage areas. Health and safety practices in accordance with the SOP must be followed throughout retrieval and transport.</p><p>Key steps for transportation include:</p><p><ul><li>Identification of patient (e.g. toe tags, infectious substance tags) </li> <li>Notification of mortuary regarding relevant information (e.g. body has implanted electronic medical device)</li> <li>Transport from hospital/other point of origin to pre-identified transportation (e.g. hearse)</li> <li>Transport via pre-identified transportation to pre-identified place of final disposition</li></ul></p><p>Appropriate tools for transport include stretchers, body bags, and flat-bed trucks or tractor-trailers. Ideally, ambulances should be reserved for transporting the living. As well, aircrafts should not be used for transporting noncremated remains. The response team should also make logistical arrangements for the transportation route, including local transport for mortuary care or burial, with relevant authorities (local and/or state) in advance.

Plans should also acknowledge how and when regular, timely data summaries will be disseminated. Flexible, interoperable data platforms and adequate, well-trained staff are critical to effective outbreak management.</p><p>Data for management in an outbreak includes, but is not limited to, case data. Field investigators may also need to manage other information stored in different systems, calling for sufficient access and adequate technology for aggregation. Specific examples of non-case data include current and projected need for laboratory materials, turnaround time from receipt of specimen to results’ availability, and school and workplace attendance and closures.</p><p>Technologies for data management include both electronic tools such as computers, software applications, and mobile devices used to collect, store, and analyze data.

Social media may be used as well.</p><p>Technologies also comprise organizational methods such as public health surveillance systems, ongoing public health databases, purpose-built databases for specific investigations, and other means of storing, managing, querying, and sharing data among devices/databases.</p><p>The main goals of technology in data management are to streamline and directly support field investigations, giving epidemiologists and laboratorians adequate time to carry out their duties. Technology platforms may be selected by factors such as the investigation’s goals, the training and skills of the staff, available technical infrastructure, and the speed and frequency with which summaries/reports are needed. As the outbreak evolves, the response team should be prepared to review selected technologies and systems to adjust as needed.</p><p>Location of data management depends on the outbreak. Some responses opt to manage findings in the field, while others rely on management and analysis off-site. For off-site management, response teams are able to avoid spending additional resources toward an on-site data management team but they must have adequate, high-quality technology to share data with relevant staff.</p><p>Specialized data management staff must be employed, either on location or remotely. This is particularly important, for field investigations are often led by individuals with largely epidemiologic, disease, and scientific knowledge bases. This expertise in leadership underscores the value of hiring a chief data scientist or chief surveillance and informatics officer at the start of the response. Duties of this individual may include coordinating the full range of data collection and management of the response; maintaining familiarity with surveillance systems, protocols, infrastructure, etc.; identifying if and when existing data management systems should be modified; and meeting regularly with response staff to ensure that activities of data collection and management are aligned with needs of the evolving response. If possible, staff should rely on little in-event training, avoiding a bottleneck with the data management response.</p><p>When packing for field deployments, response staff must bring necessary equipment for secure, effective data management.

Generic supplies include items like documentation materials (e.g., adhesive labels, permanent marker); personal protective equipment (e.g., gloves, masks, gowns, goggles); temporary cold chain support (e.g., coolers, dry ice); and some non-specific test reagents like DNA/RNA extractives. Specific supplies will include the material needed to address the particular pathogen in question, such as diagnostic testing kits and/or testing reagents. Planners developing their inventories should also consider a review of the laboratory’s necessary equipment inventory, such as computers for analysis and items for long-term storage support (e.g., freezers at –20°C/–80°C/–140°C, reliable electricity/generators).</p><p>The required supplies can be procured from national or international sources. Many private companies manufacture these supplies, especially the more general supplies. Diagnostic tests and test kits will often be made available through the central government or its bilateral/multilateral partners, and sometimes from academic laboratories. Private companies may also develop test reagents and kits. Methods for obtaining reagents and supplies vary considerably between laboratories, with some laboratories purchasing directly, whereas in many countries a national procurement system is in place with a central stores area that distributes directly to the laboratories.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup> Sometimes donors play a major role in the procurement of supplies and reagents, both during the preparedness phase and during outbreaks.</p><p>The International Reagent Resource is an entity established by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a centralized source of reagents, tools, and information for public health laboratories around the world studying and detecting influenza virus.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""4"">4</sup> The IRR can therefore support laboratories that need to build their reagent inventory for influenza specifically (although during the COVID-19 outbreak, the organization also made reagents available to the 50 United States and its territories).</p><p>Supplies can be replenished and/or modified to meet the particular needs of the outbreak.

Written summaries of surveillance and epidemiology findings provided to a country’s stakeholders (from local responders to national government) enable all parties to work from the same basis of information, enabling a more coordinated, multi-sectoral response. At the international level, notification requirements of the International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) are based on the identification within a States Party territory of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC); the goal is to capture any novel or evolving risk to international public health.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> </li> <li><strong>Genetic sequence data/information</strong>. Sharing of sequence data allows improved tracking of epidemics and aids in the development of diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccines. WHO asks that genome sequences be made publicly available as quickly as possible through relevant databases, and that benefits arising from the use of those sequences be shared equitably with the country from where the pathogen genome sequence originates. </li> <li><strong>Observational studies and clinical trials</strong>. Stakeholders should be informed of any relevant studies and trials being carried out and when results are expected. Once data are available and able to be shared, those carrying out such studies should work with researchers, funders, and journals to ensure preliminary and final results are quickly made available. It is WHO policy that all interventional clinical trials be prospectively registered in a primary clinical trials registry.</li></ul></p><p>Ultimately, outbreak data should be published in peer reviewed manuscripts to contribute to the broader scientific understanding of the pathogen or disease process. It is becoming more commonplace for authors or journals to publish such pieces as “pre-prints,” which are articles that have not yet completed peer review and other elements of the formal publication process. This became very common practice during COVID-19 to ensure that the scientific and decision-making communities were kept as up to date as possible.

Among other areas, plans should be in place that identify procedures and decision-making related to sending and receiving health personnel; address regulatory and licensure concerns of requesting/accepting and receiving health personnel from an international source; and identify training criteria and standards for health personnel who will be sent or received. Working through the technical questions of the JEE (D4.2 and R4.2) will aid in preparation.</p><p>If a general quarantine is in effect and public transportation is reduced or eliminated, this will impact essential workers’ ability to reach sites of care. Officials must have plans and policies in place that enable these personnel to reach outbreak sites. This may involve making public transport available just for essential workers, and/or developing agreements with private carriers. One way for groups of personnel, including healthcare workers, to reach a site in need is via convoy or caravan, a group of vehicles traveling together for the sake of convenience or safety. While individual vehicles can move faster and organizing a caravan takes time and planning, convoys may make sense when long distances or dangerous conditions warrant it.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup> Air transport may be the fastest or only way to move personnel from one part of the country to another, or across borders.</p><p>Personnel deployment is a key activity that cross-border agreements can be used to support. Countries should have the necessary legal and regulatory processes and logistical plans to allow for rapid cross-border deployment and receipt of public health and medical personnel.

Rapid transportation to a specialized treatment unit of patients who may be infectious must aid in the provision of access to appropriate care for that patient while also minimizing the risk of secondary spread; available infrastructure, accessible care <em>en route</em> , and the patient's clinical condition may influence the carrier’s ability to do this successfully.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup> Transportation should be provided by personnel apprised of the risks involved in transporting potentially infectious people; these personnel should be provided with personal protective equipment.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""3"">3</sup></p><p>The transfer of a sick patient may induce various physiological alterations which may adversely affect the patient’s prognosis.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""4"">4</sup> The key elements of safe transfer involve decision to transfer; communication, pre-transfer stabilization and preparation, choosing the appropriate mode of transfer; personnel accompanying the patient; equipment and monitoring; and documentation and handover of the patient at the receiving facility.</p><p>Available ground transport may range from basic motor vehicles to technologically advanced ambulances. While striving for ideal transport situations—dedicated medical ambulances with accredited medical providers on board—this may not be realistic in all circumstances. Planners may consider developing pre-existing agreements with medical transport or other transport providers. Rapid Response Teams may assist with transport during the response phase.

Triage relevant data and information,"Surveillance and epidemic intelligence, Data management","Epidemiology & lab analysis, Governance & coordination","Surveillance & preparedness, Detection, Early response, Intervention, Post-intervention & recovery","<p>Triage is a process for ranking information according to its likelihood of being relevant for the early detection of acute public health events. The triage process is crucial for differentiating between data that relate to non-acute events, like changes in endemic disease patterns, and data that correspond to an acute event of public health importance. Triage helps prevent the overwhelming of the epidemic intelligence system.<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""1"">1</sup></p><p>The World Health Organization defines triage as:<sup class=""footnote"" data-id=""2"">2</sup></p><em>the process of screening the data and information that are relevant for early detection purposes (i.e. screening out mild/irrelevant events from potential acute public health events, and cleaning to eliminate duplicates and correct obvious mistakes). </em><p>The creation of epidemic intelligence is based on the two arms of surveillance data—indicator-based surveillance (IBS) and event-based surveillance (EBS).

Interpretation is then the qualitative assessment of the significance of this information, by considering elements like seasonal, geographical and historical patterns, clinical or biological elements, and demographic information.</li> <li><strong>EBS</strong> data are 1) <em>filtered</em> and 2) <em>selected</em> for further inclusion. Filtering EBS data is necessary because the nature of the information collected is likely to reflect a high proportion of rumors and duplicates. Filtering thus consists of screening supplicates and identifying and discarding information not relevant to early warning. Selection is the sorting of information according to national priority criteria, such as for priority diseases or syndromes. Selection is the phase that has the greatest impact on the capacity of EBS to provide early detection and must be performed by epidemiologically-skilled personnel. </li></ul></p><p>All the data can then be viewed in aggregate and together lead to <em>signals</em> that can alert officials to an acute problem that requires prompt response.

Such agreements facilitate any number of activities that can advance health security. Indeed, the International Health Regulations (IHR) were put into effect for the purpose of mitigating cross-border health threats; cross-border agreements are an essential component of ensuring that the goals of the IHR are met.</p><p>During the preparedness phase, cross-border agreements should be created or updated. Countries may consider agreements with countries with which they share a border, countries in the region or on the continent, and others around the globe that may assist outbreak response in a variety of ways.
